        <h3>About the translator</h3>
        <p>
            I could have born below or above the average class but I born in mediocre family, however that’s the greatest thing Lord ever offered to me. I played in woods, carrying school bags and running for buses, hunting birds and catching animals in forest, I’m
            just another reckless boy in the world, all I had was the time to explore who am I without knowing what I am doing besides all these most nights and evening I fell a magnetic pull a fond on reading and writing and then I joined Engineering
            my life changed forever, still then I don’t even know the computer, because I’ve grown in village and eventually I been to music doing open mics these things are hard to explain I just belong in streets like a common man but that’s the greatest
            asset I have “The Freedom” to go anywhere and do anything you want nobody behind my ass and after a period of 4 years suffering with broke shirts and empty stomach filled with water along part time jobs I completed my engineering as a man
            with vision in most fields from Computers,Music, Literature, Medical, Genetics and on. There can be many ways in which life can be lived, I love all my ways been so far and here is the one of my works to spread tamil literature.
